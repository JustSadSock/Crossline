# Game Server Optimization Recommendations

This document outlines several actionable strategies to improve the performance and scalability of the Crossline game server.

## 1. Optimise the game loop data structures
- Store players and bullets in indexed arrays instead of dynamic objects so that update iterations are cache friendly and avoid repeated key enumeration.
- Keep a free-list for both arrays and reuse inactive slots when players disconnect or bullets despawn. This object-pooling technique reduces pressure on the garbage collector and avoids unnecessary allocations inside the 30 Hz tick loop.

## 2. Reduce network payload sizes
- Track which entities changed during the last tick and only serialise and transmit those updates. Unchanged player positions or status flags do not need to be re-sent each frame.
- Move invariant metadata (display name, colour theme, etc.) to the initial handshake so that steady-state updates only contain the fields that actually vary.
- Consider compressing payloads by switching from verbose JSON objects (`{"players":{"id":{"x":...}}}`) to packed arrays or dictionaries with shorter keys.

## 3. Adopt binary or schema-driven protocols
- Replace JSON payloads with binary buffers (for example, `ArrayBuffer` / `Buffer`) so that coordinates and angles are written as 32-bit floats and identifiers as unsigned integers, shrinking the frame footprint.
- Alternatively, integrate a purpose-built multiplayer framework such as [Colyseus](https://www.colyseus.io/) which already provides efficient state-sync, schema definition, and room management utilities.
- Ensure the client performs feature detection during the handshake (e.g., `{"type":"protocol","format":"binary"}`) so that legacy JSON clients continue to function.

## 4. Broaden server scalability safeguards
- Batch physics and collision checks by spatial partitioning (uniform grid or quad-tree) to avoid `O(n^2)` checks when the player count rises.
- Schedule periodic snapshots less frequently than physics ticks (e.g., 15â€“20 Hz) and interpolate client-side rendering to keep latency low while reducing outbound bandwidth.

Implementing these suggestions should make the real-time loop more CPU efficient, decrease bandwidth consumption, and leave room for future player-count increases.
